# Fitzo - Project Context

## What is Fitzo?

Fitzo is a **mobile-first Gym SaaS application** designed for medium-sized gyms and training studios in India. Unlike enterprise gym management software, Fitzo prioritizes simplicity, daily usage, and social features.

## Core Philosophy

| Principle | What We Do | What We Avoid |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Simple over Powerful** | Essential features only | Feature bloat |
| **Useful over Feature-rich** | Daily-use tools | Rarely-used analytics |
| **Social over Transactional** | Gym buddies, intents | Enterprise reports |
| **Mobile-only** | Touch-first design | Desktop dashboards |

## Inspiration

✅ **Inspired by:**
- Duolingo (gamification, learning streaks)
- Cult-like simplicity (but not Cult complexity)

❌ **Not inspired by:**
- ERP systems
- Mindbody-style dashboards
- Spreadsheet-like UIs

## Target Users

1. **Members** - Primary users who check-in, set workout intents, connect with gym buddies
2. **Trainers** - View assigned members, workout plans, attendance
3. **Managers** - Quick overview of gym status, add people

## Key Differentiators

- **No ERP behavior** - No complex dashboards, reports, or admin panels
- **Social-first** - Gym buddies system with workout intent sharing
- **Duolingo-style learning** - Bite-sized fitness education
- **Privacy-respecting** - Workout intent visibility controls (public/friends/private)
- **Gamified** - Streaks, XP, badges without being childish

## Design Language

- **Theme**: Onyx (black) & Snow (white) with transparency
- **Typography**: Lexend font family
- **Style**: Glassmorphism, rounded cards, large tap targets
- **Principle**: Every screen understandable in under 5 seconds
