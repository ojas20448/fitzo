## 🎨 Design System Issues

### Color & Theming
- [ ] **LOW_001**: Inconsistent use of glass surface opacity - some components use `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)` directly instead of `colors.glass.surface`
- [ ] **LOW_002**: Crowd indicator colors (green/amber/red) break the monochrome "Onyx & Snow" theme - consider using white with varying opacity/glow effects
- [ ] **LOW_003**: The `success` color is `#FFFFFF` in theme but `colors.crowd.low` (green) is used for success states - inconsistent
- [ ] **LOW_004**: No dark mode toggle - app is locked to dark theme only
- [ ] **LOW_005**: Missing accent color variations - everything is pure white which can feel monotonous

### Typography
- [ ] **TYP_001**: Section titles use `textTransform: 'uppercase'` inconsistently across screens
- [ ] **TYP_002**: Font weights jump directly from 400 to 700 in many places - no intermediate weights used
- [ ] **TYP_003**: Line heights not consistently applied - some text feels cramped
- [ ] **TYP_004**: No letter-spacing guidelines being followed consistently

### Spacing
- [ ] **SPC_001**: Inconsistent bottom padding for scroll content - some use `{ height: 100 }` spacer, others don't
- [ ] **SPC_002**: Tab bar overlaps content on some screens without proper safe area handling
- [ ] **SPC_003**: Section spacing varies between `xl` and `2xl` inconsistently

## 📱 Component Issues

### Button Component
- [ ] **BTN_001**: No loading spinner animation - just static `ActivityIndicator`
- [x] **BTN_002**: Ghost button has no visual feedback on press ✅ Added scale animation
- [x] **BTN_003**: No ripple effect for Android - missing `android_ripple` prop ✅ Added
- [x] **BTN_004**: Disabled state is too subtle - hard to distinguish from enabled ✅ Improved
- [x] **BTN_005**: Missing button variants: `danger`, `link`, `outline-primary` ✅ Added danger/outline

### GlassCard Component
- [ ] **GLS_001**: No blur effect - `backdrop-filter` doesn't work in React Native without additional libraries
- [ ] **GLS_002**: Active variant text color assumes parent will handle it - can cause color collisions
- [ ] **GLS_003**: No press state for interactive cards
- [ ] **GLS_004**: Missing hover/focus states for accessibility

### Avatar Component
- [ ] **AVT_001**: Grayscale effect using opacity instead of actual grayscale filter
- [ ] **AVT_002**: Default avatar is a remote URL - should have local fallback for offline
- [ ] **AVT_003**: Border always uses `colors.primary` - should be configurable
- [x] **AVT_004**: No skeleton loading state while image loads ✅ Added skeleton loading
- [x] **AVT_005**: Missing initials fallback when name is available ✅ Added initials fallback

### Badge Component
- [x] **BDG_001**: Limited variants - needs `warning`, `error`, `info` ✅ Added all variants
- [ ] **BDG_002**: Icon positioning is inconsistent with text alignment

### WeeklyProgress Component
- [ ] **WKP_001**: Static weekly target (hardcoded 4) - should come from user settings

- [ ] **WKP_004**: Past week data not visible - can't see historical trends

- [ ] **NUT_002**: No breakdown of macros (protein/carbs/fat) in summary view
- [ ] **NUT_003**: Target calories hardcoded to 2500 - should be personalized
- [ ] **NUT_004**: No weekly/monthly trend view

### CrowdIndicator Component
- [x] **CRD_001**: "Live" indicator has no pulsing animation to indicate live status ✅ Added pulse animation
- [ ] **CRD_002**: No history/trend of crowd levels

## 📝 Notes

- The glassmorphism effect (`backdrop-filter`) requires `expo-blur` or similar library
- Consider using `react-native-reanimated` for performant animations
- Lottie could be used for celebration animations
- ~~Consider implementing a toast/snackbar library like `react-native-toast-message`~~ ✅ Custom Toast created
